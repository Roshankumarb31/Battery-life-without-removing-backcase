This file is done for TATA Hackathon,2022.

We developed a device that would be used to detect the the remaining power in a watch battery.
Watch is something, which is a part of our life and there exists a seperate market and fan-base for watches.
But even the manufactures have a problem of checking the battert power.
At sales, the salesperson must remove the backcover in ordre to check the power.
Our idea is to overcome this problem in a more efficient way.


Our device too won't cost much....Its affordable just like a 8gb pendrive :)
